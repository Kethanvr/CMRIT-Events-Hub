## 📖 Overview

**CMRIT Events Hub** (CMRIT-Events) is a robust, full-stack platform built to revolutionize how students interact with campus activities. It bridges the gap between students and club administrators, providing a seamless verifiable record of participation, achievements, and skills.

Solving the problem of fragmented notifications and manual tracking, this platform offers a **"One-Line Source of Truth"**—an automated, verified profile that grows with every hackathon, workshop, and event a student attends.

## ✨ Key Features

The platform operates on a dual-ecosystem model catering to both Students and Administrators.

### 🚀 For Students (Growth Ecosystem)
- **Dynamic Student Profile**: An automated "Campus Resume" that tracks every event and achievement.
- **Verifiable Proof of Work**: Skills and projects are verified by actual participation, not just claims.
- **Centralized Events Platform**: Discover and register for hackathons and workshops effortlessly.
- **XP & Leaderboards**: A gamified "Anti-Cheat" system where XP is earned only through verified attendance.
- **Team Formation**: Streamlined tools to find teammates and join communities.

### 🏛️ For Administrators (Management Ecosystem)
- **Complete Event Lifecycle**: From creation to QR-code based attendance tracking and winner declarations.
- **Club Management**: Tools for managing rosters, applications, and leadership roles.
- **Automated Galleries**: Repositories for event photos and culture showcases.
- **Communication Channels**: Dedicated announcements and group link management.
